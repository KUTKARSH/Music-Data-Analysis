# 🎧 Music-Data-Analysis

A scalable **Big Data model** designed to analyze and extract insights from large-scale **music streaming data**. This system can be applied in real-world industry use cases for tracking **top artists**, **popular songs**, and **listener trends by region**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project enables analysis of key music data points such as:

- ✅ Top trending **artists**
- ✅ Most listened **songs**
- ✅ Regions with the **highest listener activity**
- ✅ Customizable queries for listener behavior and content trends

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** – Data preprocessing and ETL scripting  
- **Hive** – Data warehousing and query execution (SQL-like)  
- **HBase** – NoSQL database for scalable, fast access  
- **Shell Scripting** – Data ingestion automation  
- **Hue** – Query execution interface and data visualization  
- **JSP & HTML** – Basic frontend interface (optional reporting)

## ⚙️ Functional Capabilities

- Data ingestion from raw logs or structured CSV
- Query interface to:
  - List top artists by play count
  - Find most streamed songs in a given timeframe
  - Identify geographic listener trends
- Storage layer: Hive for analytics, HBase for real-time lookup

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set up Hadoop ecosystem with Hive and HBase
2. Ingest the dataset using shell or Python scripts
3. Run queries via Hue or CLI
4. (Optional) Host a simple reporting dashboard with JSP/HTML
